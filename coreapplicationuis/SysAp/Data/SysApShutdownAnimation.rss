/**
* Instructions for enabling operator variated animation:
*
* - Add #include of *.mbg file
* - Follow instruction to fill in appropriate value for r_anim_duration,
*   r_shutdown_anim, r_shutdown_tone_path and r_shutdownanim_frames.
* - Recompile SysApShutdownAnimation.rss resource file. Note: if you use abld script
*   check that date has been modified; it might be required to remove
*   previous compiled resource file.
* - You can rename compiled resource file for specific locale, just like
*   in case of normal resources.
* - When making ROM image, make sure that the necessary compiled Shutdown 
*   resource files are included and the Shutdown animation file exists.
* - Test that ROM image works OK for each locale.
