CONARC 044
---------
Made by Diana Bettoney 26 October 1999

Not to be included in mainline builds yet

Correct includes in conlist.h
Correct various CleanupStack omissions and now derive CMimeInfo from CBase.

CONARC 043
---------
Made by Diana Bettoney 22 October 1999

Not to be included in mainline builds yet

Changed functions CCnaConverterList::ConvFromListL and CCnaConverterList::ConvToListL to
return useful information in structure SConverterInfo

Fixed test tloadcnv which was broken in release 041 by change to CConverterBase
Fixed base converters that were broken by this change.

Warning to all users of class CConverterBase

The  parameter MConverterObserver* is no longer const so all converters using any convert functions
will need to be changed.

class CConverterBase : public CBase
// abstract base class for all converters
	{
public:
	enum TCapability
		{
		EConvertsFiles=0x01,
		EConvertsObjects=0x02,
		EConvertsExtract=0x04
		};
public:
	IMPORT_C virtual void ConvertL(const TFileName& aSourceFile, const TFileName& aTargetFile, MConverterObserver* aObserver=NULL); // These default to calling the async versions in a loop
	IMPORT_C virtual void ConvertObjectL(RReadStream& aReadStream, RWriteStream& aWriteStream, MConverterObserver* aObserver=NULL);
	IMPORT_C virtual void ConvertAL(const TFileName& aSourceFile, const TFileName& aTargetFile, MConverterObserver* aObserver=NULL); // these default to leaving with KErrNotSupported
	IMPORT_C virtual void ConvertObjectAL(RReadStream& aReadStream, RWriteStream& aWriteStream, MConverterObserver* aObserver=NULL); // these default to leaving with KErrNotSupported
	IMPORT_C virtual TBool DoConvertL(); // these default to leaving with KErrNotSupported
	virtual TUid Uid() =0;
	IMPORT_C virtual TInt Capabilities(); // defaults to "everything"
	IMPORT_C virtual void CancelConvert(); // for any cleanup
	};

Made by Diana Bettoney 28 September 1999

Not to be included in mainline builds yet

Fixed bug in CNFTOOL.CPP introduced in version 40.

To Build and run CNFTOOL

On the line for Cnftool in the BLD.INF file remove the ignore.
You will then be able to create a makefile for cnftool and build it using bldmake and abld.
Copy your RSS file to the CNFTOOL directory and run CNFTOOL.BAT with the name of your RSS file
to create the CNF file.

CONARC 041
----------
Made by SimonC 14 September 1999

Uses baseline 00008

Not to be included in mainline builds yet

Not source or binary compatible with 040

Various changes suggested by Paul Stevens:

1) Renamed the method:
   CConverterBase* CCnaConverterList::Converter(TUid aUid)
to 
   CConverterBase* CCnaConverterList::NewConverterL(TUid aUid)

2) Added EConvertsExtract to CConverterBase::TCapability

3) Added the following methods to MConverterObserver
	TBool GetEmbeddedFileName(TFileName& aFileName);
and
	HBufC* QueryPasswordL(const TDesC& aClue);

4) Added the utility function
	TUid ConverterL(const TDataType& aFrom,const TDataType& aTo);
to CCnaConverterList



CONARC 040
----------
Made by Diana Bettoney 3 September 1999

Add support for translations of mimetypes in the cnf file.
Improved test code to give better instructions to user as tests fail if files are not
copied to the correct locations.
Added test code to test translations.

CONARC 033
----------
Made by Steph Rolland 26 August 1999

Removed warnings
Fixed unicode defect in text/Etext conversion

CONARC 032
----------
Made by Darren Jones 19 May 1999

Changes in preparation for auto-building


CONARC 031
----------
Made by Darren Jones 16 Mar 1999

More development/fixes for unicode builds and ER5u


CONARC 030
----------
Made by Darren Jones 3 Mar 1999

Development/fixes for unicode builds and ER5u

CONARC 010
----------
Made by MattM 25 Jan 1999

Fixed:
EDN028229 Missing forward declaration in CONLIST.H
EDN881056 vcard notes with embedded = are not exported properly
EDN263447 Conarc needs boilerplated comments

Fixed some madness with =CRLF conversion, these should be thrown away on decoding.

CONARC 009
----------
Made by MattM 4 Jan 1999

Removed internal converter exports - the implementation of these is now
completely transparent to clients.

Fixed:
EDN060426 QP encoder is broken

CONARC 008
----------
Made by MattM 22 December 1998

Made the internal converters transparent to clients.  No changes are needed to
use these.

CONARC 007
----------
Made by MattM 18 December 1998

Fixed many errors in OOM (thanks to CNTMODEL for the testing)

Moved the Quoted Printable, Base64 and ETEXT->Text converters into the
converter architecture as utility converters.

This adds a Header only dependency on ETEXT

ROM builders!

the following converters are no longer required in a ROM:

QPCONV.CNF
QPCONV.CNV
TXCONV.CNF
TXCONV.CNV
B64CONV.CNF
B64CONV.CNV

Fixed ebld defect where "all" or "conarc" was required for build

CONARC 006
----------
Made by MattM 16 December 1998

Fixed
EDN885611 Constructing a converter finder can leave if an invalid converter pair exist
EDN97E-02 CONFNDR.H declares a local function without implementing it

Fixed leaky RFs session.

CONARC 005
----------
Made by MattM 4 November 1998

Changed CNF file UID's in unicode build back to same as narrow build
CNF files are build invariant.

CONARC 004
----------
Made by MattM 29 October 1998

Deb/Rel and Unicode UID release.

UID's for Converter DLL's are now:

uid				0x10000C61
unicodeuid		0x10003A30


CONARC 003
----------
Made by MattM 7 October 1998

Fixed MNT GETREL

Fixed converter load failure in WINS REL and UREL builds

Passes tests on

WINS REL, WINS DEB, WINS UREL, WINS UDEB
MARM REL

Other MARM variants not tested.

CONARC 002
----------
Made by MattM 5 Octover 1998

Tidied up releaseables.

Added MARM freeze files for converter DLLs

CONARC 001
----------
Made by MattM 16 September 1998

This release is uninteresting - everything other than MNT files is as of CONVERT 020

Split converters architecture from concrete converters

Concrete converters and test code now live in \convert
Architecture lives in \conarc
